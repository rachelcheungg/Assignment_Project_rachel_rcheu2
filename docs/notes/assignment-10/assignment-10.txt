What API you picked and why
* I chose the Open Library API because I think it was the most related to my project.
  The idea for my website is to allow users to list/post their favorite online stores or finds.
  The Open Library API is related in the sense that users could list their favorite books.
  Additionally, I chose this API because it's public, keyless, and provides rich data on books and authors.

What fields you extracted
* The API endpoint I used is: https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=<query>.
  This returns a JSON object with a list of book documents under the "docs" key.
  From the raw JSON, I extracted "author_name", "title", and "first_publish_year" from the "docs" key.

How you handled errors/timeouts
* To avoid crashes when data was missing, I used the .get() method.
  I added timeout=5 in the requests.get() call to handle slow responses and prevent the page from hanging.

What the final JSON looks like (this is a sample of the output since it's rather large):
{
  "library": [
    {
      "author": [
        "Jane Austen"
      ],
      "book": "Sense and Sensibility",
      "first_published": 1811
    },
    {
      "author": [
        "Chandeep Chhabra"
      ],
      "book": "Power Query Beyond the User Interface",
      "first_published": 2025
    },
  ]
}

Any API limitation or quirk you noticed
* One limitation is that I wasn't able to figure out how to filter strictly by author.
  I think this is tricky because it depends on how metadata is stored.

Other notes:
* I used ChatGPT to help me filter out the fields I wanted ('author_name', 'title', and 'first_publish_year')
  since it was nested in the "docs" key, and I wasn't sure how to extract them.
* I also used ChatGPT to help me create the library_books.html and to troubleshoot issues I was having with implementing
  a "clear" button.
* After today's (11/06/2025) presentations, I implemented the suggestions:
    * I first modified LibraryBooksRender view so that the API request to Open Library is only made when a search query
      is present.
    * Then I added pagination by updating LibraryBooksRender view and the corresponding library_books.html template.
    * I used ChatGPT to help me implement these suggestions.
