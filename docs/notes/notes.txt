Ideas & Selection Rationale:
* Assignment Project Ideas:
    * sales tracker
        - tracks sales happening in stores/online and lists them on the website
        - can display the most popular sales and filter sales by category (electronics, clothes, etc.)
    * shared calendar
        - share a calendar with friends and see each of their schedules
        - send hangout requests
For the assignment project, I will do the sales tracker.
I think it would be more interesting to build than a shared calendar web app.

Wireframe Notes:
I only have an idea for the homepage currently.
I wanted it to have the main features, which are searching by name or category and displaying the most popular sales.

Branching Strategy:
I chose to use the GitHub Flow branching strategy because it keeps things simple.
There will be a main branch and a features branch.
Each feature will generally be the assignment for the week.

Branch Usage Reflections:
I named my branch features for the time being since we're just getting started.
I was able to create, commit, and push without any issues.

Django Setup
I chose the name "sales_tracker" because it's my main project goal: to build a website that tracks sales from stores.
I named the startapp folder "sales" for the time being, since I couldn't think of what else to name it.
It was configured correctly.

Virtual Environment Choices:
I chose to use my own virtual environment.
It's more ideal for Python-only projects and I mainly just prefer this over the conda environment.
