I first created the HttpResponse view, which is the manual way of sending a response back to the browser.
Then I created the render view, which is a shortcut that automates what happens in HttpResponse.
I used the same html template for both views, but created different url addresses for each.

To make the urls more organized, I created an app-level urls.py that adds specific endpoints to the base path in the project-level urls.py.

I had some issues along the way with getting the data to show on the website, but I was able to fix it.
It was because I had the wrong variable name written in the user_list.html template.

I'd still like to update the base.html file to make it look better on the UI side.
